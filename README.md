# Landing Page

This project is the second of FEND-Udacity projects, and it includes Javascript.

## My approach to the project

_1-Built the HTML & CSS first_

_2-used queryselector to select all `<section>` elements_

_3-used for..of loop to iterate through array-like object (nodelist)_

_4-added event listeners to each element_

## Resources
