# Landing Page

This project is the second of FEND-Udacity projects, and it includes Javascript.

## My approach to the project

- build two functions to active section and inactive section
- build function to create navigation links
- combined functions into for..of loop that would the first two functions to every section and call linkCreator function and pass it a section
